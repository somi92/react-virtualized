Things to do before publishing a new version of the package:
	- update the name field in package.json with appropriate scope prefix 
	- update the version field in package.json by adding prerelease tag suffix with appropriate version
	- DO NOT COMMIT AND PUSH THESE CHANGES

If you are not sure which scope prefix and/or prerelease tag to use, ask someone from the team for support.
